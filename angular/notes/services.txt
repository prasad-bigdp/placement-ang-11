Services: Service  is used to share , store common data or common functionalities. it is a class that encapsulates specific or group of common functionalities. it is used to share data between components and remove concerns from components

services are injected into component using constructor injection

to create a new service, we can use command 
ng generate service service-name

Dependency injection: it is a technique where one component receives another component(dependent receives dependency ) rather than creating the dependency itself

services need to be mentioned inside module

services can be used for API logics so that it can get data and share it with any component. it uses a method called httpClient.
