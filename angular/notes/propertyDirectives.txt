Property Directives are used to manipulate the DOM using poperties such as
ngClass
ngStyle

ngClass: ngClass is used to assign a class value to an element dynamically such that styles can be altered
   <some-element [ngClass]="isLight ? 'light' : 'dark' ">
  
    </some-element>

ngStyle: ngStyle is used to assign style properties directly to an element dynamically such that styles can be altered
     <some-element [ngStyle]="{display:isLight ? 'light' : 'dark' "}>
  
    </some-element>
