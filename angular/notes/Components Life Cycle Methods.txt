Components Life Cycle Methods:
Every component undergoes different stages of its 
life cycle. these methods are default methods which will be called at different stages of its life cycle
  1. initial stage: constructor is the default method which gets triggered first when the component started to render
 2. mounting: In this stage the components will start to render for view
    i. ngOnChanges: this method will be triggered everytime a value changes within a component
   ii. ngOnInit : this method will be used only when the component rendered first time/
   iii. ngDoCheck: this method will be called right after ngOnInit and will check whether component is ready or not. it will be called every checking time
3. update stage:
   when ever a component got updated
   ngOnChanges and ngDoCheck will get triggered for every change
   iv. ngAfterContentInit: called after the components content got initialised
   v. ngAfterContentChecked: called after the components contents got checked.
  vi.ngAfterviewInit : called after the components view got initialised
  vii.ngAfterViewChecked: called after the components view got checked
 for every change ngAfterviewChecked and ngAfterContentChecked will trigger again

4. unmounting stage: In this stage, component will be destroyed
  viii. ngDestroy : will be triggered after the component got destroyed
