Angular routing is a powerful feature that enables client side routing. it allows users to navigate from one page to another page or one component to another component.
All routes should be mentioned within an array and these array should be rendered within routing module

 step 1: goto routing.module.ts and update routes array like below:
 const routes: Routes = [
  { path:'',component:HomeComponent},
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  { path:'contact', component:ContactComponent}
];

step 2: goto app.componenet.html and mention
<router-outlet></router-outlet>

step 3: goto header and change links as routerLink istead of href like
<a routerLink="/home">home</a>
