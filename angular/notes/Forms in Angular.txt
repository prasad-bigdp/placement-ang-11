Forms in Angular:
    Angular provides two types of forms
  i. Template Driven Forms: These forms are created using HTML templates and are useful for simple forms
 ii. Reactive Forms: These forms are created using typescript programming. Theses are used for complex forms
  
Template Driven Forms: 
   i. we use 'ngModel' directive to bind the controls /properties to the component
   ii. we use 'ngForm' directive to create binding of form and its elements
   iii. we use 'name' attribute to find the controls
   
 <input type="text" name="na" ngModel>
 now ngModel will create a class object for FormControl which contains lot of default values for form validation such as
  a. touched: will be true if user just touches the input. untouched is the opposite
  b. dirty: will be true if user changes the previous value and pristine is the opposite
  c. valid : valid will be true if user entered value passes validation and invalid is the opposite
  d. errors: it is an array contains list of errors

 we can do validations using these variables like 
   <input type="text" name="na" ngModel>
   <p *ngIf="na.touched && na?.errors?.['required']>please enter a value</p>
