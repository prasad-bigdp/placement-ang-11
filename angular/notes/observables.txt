In Javascript, http requests are done by fetch method. it is default browser method used for different API requests such GET,POST,PUT,DELETE etc..,

fetch or any asynchronous function returns promises. A promise is a object which describes eventual completion of asynchronous operation. it brings three states such as pending, fulfilled, rejected

we can resolve promises using then and catch . if promise is fulfilled it will run then case else catch case

for eg: fetch(url)
           .then((res)=>res.json())
           .then((data)=>console.log(data))
           .catch((err)=>console.log(err))

In Angular, httpRequests are done by HttpClient
   i. import HttpClient and Inject into service(mention object of HttpClient in constructor parameter)
   ii. import and mention HttpClientModule in app.module.ts

HttpClient can perform GET,POST,PUT,DELETE operations
It returns an observable. A observable is a stream of asynchronous data that ccan be subscribed to.
It is like a stream of videos comes once you subscribed to the channel.
   i. observables emit only asynchronous data means you don't know when the data comes
   ii. observables are lazy means they load/emit only if someone is listening
   iii.observable can emit multiple values 
   iv. complete: observable can complete means they can stop whenever its needed
   v. error handling: observables can even handle errors
